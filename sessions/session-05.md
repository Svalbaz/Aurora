## Session Summary
The party confronted and defeated the Twink in a hard-fought battle. However, before her death, she activated a Ring of Three Wishes, using a Wish to reset events.

Reality warped.

The party found themselves teleported back to the Shrine — before key events had occurred. This time, however, they retained their memories of both the Shrine’s riddles and the combat that followed.

With knowledge of what was to come, they were able to answer the Shrine’s riddles immediately, armed with foresight… and the unsettling awareness that something in the timeline had changed.
